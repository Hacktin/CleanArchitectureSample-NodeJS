### Technologies
* MySQL

#### Frameworks/Libraries
* ExpressJS

* Util for managment to db object and that db object can be async


### Techniques

* ''Depency Injection'' because avoid dependence between layers.For example;UseCases layer method's dbParameter never should be know directly to which dbTechnology is actually.

* "Basicly Validation" because if incoming request is not adapted to the rules we want,we will not save request's data to db.There!Ä°f you want to handle this,you should write or use validate data mechanism
